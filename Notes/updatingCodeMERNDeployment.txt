Updating your code and refreshing your installation:
If you find a bug and want to fix it...or just add some fun extras so you can show this off to friends, do the following:

Update your code and test it on your local computer.
Stage and commit your code to your git repository using the command line or your VSCode editor's tools
Push the changes up to github: git push
Connect via SSH to your instance as described above

Change directory in to your project folder: cd ~/MERN-Deployment
Stop the PM2 process daemon: pm2 stop all
This should stop the express/node server
Pull the recent changes from github using: git pull
Change directory in to the client folder: cd client
Rebuild the React App: npm run build
Stop the currently running nginx process:  
sudo service nginx stop
sudo service nginx status <-- verify that it is "inactive"
Replace the running React App and remember to update the URLs using grep and sed:
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html
sudo mv build /var/www/html
sudo grep -rl localhost /var/www/html | xargs sed -i 's/http:\/\/localhost:8000//g'
Restart the PM2 process: pm2 restart all
This should restart your express/node server
Restart the React app
sudo service nginx restart
sudo service nginx status <-- verify that it is "active (running)"
To view the server logs while using PM2, run the following command:

sudo pm2 logs
To exit viewing the logs use: 

CTRL + c
